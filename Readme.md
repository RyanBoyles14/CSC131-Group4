### 1.0 Introduction:
###### The introduction for this SRS document provides an overview on the entire document, including the purpose, scope, definitions, and references.
---
<a name="purpose"></a>
#### 1.1. Purpose
###### The purpose of this document is to cover all of the ideas and definitions that define our system, the requirements in respect to the user, and the intended use.
###### Its purpose is to provide an overview of the software, its parameters, uses, and goals. It describes the target audience, user interface, hardware and software requirements, and functionality.
    
<a name="scope"></a>
#### 1.2. Scope
###### This software is developed as a group project for a Computer Science 131 - Computer Software Engineering at California State University - Sacramento.
###### The scope of this project is to provide software metrics of a Git repository. Through providing a GitHub url, the user can obtain informative software metrics about Java, C, and C++ projects.
    
<a name="def"></a>
#### 1.3. Definitions
###### - Metrics                   Methods for measuring some statistics or properties
###### - Halstead Metrics:         Measurable properties of software, including length, difficulty, and bugs
###### - Depth of Inheritance:     The maximum length of a class to its root of inheritance
###### - Coupling Between Classes: The connection between classes
###### - Method Time Complexity:   Time taken for a method to compute
###### - Git Commits:              Git contributors and their changes to a Git repository
    
<a name="ref"></a>
#### 1.4. References
###### Maven: <https://maven.apache.org>:       Used to create the .jar file to run the software in CLI. It compiles the require external libraries and packages them with our developed classes.
###### JGit: <https://www.eclipse.org/jgit>:    Used to clone a repository from Git. This allows us to clone all files using a Git url and calculate metrics on the files in the repository.
###### ANTLR: <https://antlr.org>:              Used to generate Java files based on Java and C++ grammar. Used to build a parse tree for interpreting Java and C++ files.
   
<a name="overview"></a>
#### 1.5. Overview
###### The rest of this document provides a general description of the software in Section 2, including product functionality, characteristics of the user, and the assumptions, dependencies, and constraints of the hardware and software.
###### Section 3 gives the requirements of the system, including functional and external interface requirements.

### 2.0 Overall Description
---

<a name="perspective"></a>
#### 2.1. Product Perspective
###### To be completed
    
<a name="functions"></a>
#### 2.2. Product Functions
###### When running the application, the user must include a link to a Git repository. The user has the option to choose specific metrics to find.

<a name="userChar"></a>
#### 2.3. User Characteristics
###### To be completed
    
<a name="genConstr"></a>
#### 2.4. General Constraints
###### The user will require an internet connection for the application to grab a Git repository.
    
<a name="assumptions"></a>
#### 2.5. Assumptions and Dependencies
###### - We are assuming the user has enough memory to temporarily hold the cloned files from the Git repository.

###### - We are assuming the user's Java, C, and C++ files function and can be properly parsed.
